# ReciCalc
Greenfield Project for Hack Reactor

Notes from Lucas: 
* The 'data_samples' folder contains examples of the way data looks (or should look) going into and coming out of various functions.
* Backend data formatting is mostly done in the db.js file, using the parsers.js helpers.
* Ideas for further expansion:
** Add users, authentication, private recipes.
** Ability to clone and/or edit recipes
** Recipe nutrition previews on the create screen.
** Fuzzy searches in the database - let a user who types 'buter' be able to get butter.
